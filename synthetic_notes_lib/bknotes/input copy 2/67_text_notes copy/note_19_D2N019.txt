Right elbow pain.

HPI:

Ms. Hernandez is a 48-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right elbow pain. She states she was moving boxes from the truck into the house yesterday and felt a pop in her elbow. She has tried applying ice and taking Ibuprofen, but it does not help. She has a history of anaphylaxis and has an EpiPen. Her past surgical history is significant for neck surgery.

EXAM

Examination of the right elbow shows tenderness over the lateral epicondyle. Swelling and redness are noted. Pain with flexion and extension of the elbow. Pain over the dorsal aspect of the forearm.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right elbow shows no obvious signs of acute fracture. Mild effusion about the lateral aspect.

IMPRESSION

Right elbow lateral epicondylitis.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended a sling for comfort. We discussed ice and anti-inflammatory medications. I will prescribe Motrin, 800 mg to take every 6 hours. She will follow up with me as needed if she continues to have pain. All questions were answered.
