ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up. He presented to the emergency room for chest pain and elevated blood pressure of 180/95. His EKG from the emergency room was normal, but ejection fraction on echocardiogram was abnormal. His blood pressure today was still elevated.

Chest pain and hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.
• Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
