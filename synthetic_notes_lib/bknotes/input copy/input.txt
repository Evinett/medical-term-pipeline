Medical Notes:

The patient, Roger Ward, has a history of asthma. Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. It is caused by inflammation and narrowing of the airways in the lungs.

Professor. Ward reports experiencing asthma symptoms for several years, including wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing, especially during exercise or exposure to allergens such as dust, pollen, or pet dander. He also reports using a rescue inhaler as needed to alleviate his symptoms.

During the physical examination, the patient's lung sounds were noted to be mildly diminished, with occasional expiratory wheezing. Spirometry testing was performed, which revealed a decreased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and a decreased forced vital capacity (FVC), consistent with obstructive lung disease.

Based on the patient's history and physical examination, a diagnosis of asthma was made. The patient was prescribed a daily maintenance inhaler containing a corticosteroid to reduce airway inflammation and a long-acting bronchodilator to improve airflow. He was also advised to continue using his rescue inhaler as needed for acute asthma symptoms.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor the patient's asthma control and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. The patient was advised to avoid triggers that may exacerbate his asthma symptoms and to maintain good asthma self-management practices, including proper inhaler technique and regular monitoring of his symptoms.
