CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.

Starting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss. Today, she reports no back pain.

She denies fever, chills, new onset of bowel or bladder dysfunction, tingling or numbness.

Integumentary
Skin is in tact.

Musculoskeletal
Extremities: No bilateral ankle edema or calf tenderness.
Examination of gait: Heel-walk and toe-walk are intact.
Cervical spine exam: No tenderness is elicited. Range of motion is full in all planes without pain. Spurling's test is negative.
Lumbar spine exam: Range of motion is decreased in extension and lateral flexion without pain. No tenderness is elicited in the midline.
Sacroiliac joint exam: Bilateral sacroiliac joints are nontender to palpation.
Bilateral hip exam: Range of motion is decreased in the right hip with pain in the groin on internal and external rotation. Resisted right hip flexion causes pain in the right groin region. Bilateral trochanteric regions are nontender to palpation.

Neurological
Motor bulk and tone are normal in both lower extremities. Motor strength testing reveals no focal motor weakness in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ throughout. No focal sensory deficit is noted.

RESULTS

MR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.
