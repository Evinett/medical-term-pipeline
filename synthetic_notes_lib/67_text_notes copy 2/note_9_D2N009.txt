Bryan Smith is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for and prior discectomy, who presents with back pain.

The patient experiences pain while bending over. He has a history of a discectomy. He is worried that something happened. He has been taking ibuprofen, which has not been beneficial alone. With the combination of Tylenol and ibuprofen, he experiences symptomatic relief. He denies numbness and tingling in his legs, and any problems with his bladder or bowels.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Bryan Smith is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for prior discectomy, who presents with back pain.

Lumbar strain.
• Medical Reasoning: He reports right-sided low back after moving a refrigerator approximately 5 days ago. X-ray of his lumbar spine is unremarkable. I do not believe this is related to his previous discectomy.
• Additional Testing: We will order a MRI of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily, as well as Ultram 50 mg every 4 hours as needed.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer him to physical therapy to be started after we get his MRI results back.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to discontinue the use of ibuprofen, but he may continue using Tylenol if he wishes.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
