Right upper arm pain.

HPI:

Ms. Russell is a 39-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of severe right upper arm pain. She states she was playing volleyball yesterday and fell and landed on her arm. She has been taking ibuprofen every 6 hours but it does not help. She rates her pain 9/10. She denies any numbness or tingling in her arm. She has a history of gallstones and takes Pepcid. She has a past surgical history of a lumbar fusion 6 years ago. She denies any allergies.

EXAM

Examination of the right upper extremity shows swelling and erythema of the right shoulder. Tenderness over the right shoulder. Normal pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right humerus, 2 views, obtained on today's visit show a proximal humerus fracture.

IMPRESSION

Right proximal humerus fracture.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended we place her into a long arm cast and sling. She will follow up in 2 weeks for repeat imaging. At that point, we may need to discuss surigical options. I will prescribe Lortab, 5 mg, #20 (twenty) to take every 6 hours as needed for pain.

All questions were answered.
