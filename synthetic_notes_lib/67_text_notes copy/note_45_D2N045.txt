RESULTS

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right knee sprain.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is an avid runner and her symptoms appear to be the result of overuse.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the nature of her diagnosis, as well as her x-ray results, in detail. I advised her that this is a common issue for runners and encouraged her to continue her strength training exercises.
- Medical Treatment: She will take Tylenol 500 mg, 2 tablets, and ibuprofen 200 mg, 2 tablets, 3 times daily to reduce her pain and inflammation. We will also refer her to physical therapy to help strengthen her lower extremities, work on her balance, and demonstrate proper running exercises. She should avoid running for the next 2 weeks until her follow up visit, at which point we can consider adding some additional activity.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.
