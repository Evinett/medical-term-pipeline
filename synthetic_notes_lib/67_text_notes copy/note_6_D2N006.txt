CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up of chronic problems.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems. It has been about 6 months since I last saw the patient.

The patient reports her arthritis is starting to get better. She has been trying to move her body with pilates and lifting weights. This has helped build up some muscles and her joint pain has reduced. The patient has also continued to attend physical therapy, which she feels has been beneficial.

Ms. Mitchell had an episode of gout of her right first big toe about 2 months ago. She states she is doing well on the allopurinol 100 mg once daily and has had no further flare ups.

Regarding her acid reflux, she was placed on omeprazole 40 mg once a day to help with some of the symptoms she was having. She started to make some dietary modifications, but she still needs to make more progress. She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning. The patient also has abdominal pain and bloating. Her last bowel movement was 2 days ago, and it was normal. She denies blood in her stool.

The patient denies unexplained weight gain or loss, fevers, chills.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems.

Acid reflux with nausea and vomiting.
• Medical Reasoning: She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning, as well as abdominal pain and bloating. She has been compliant with omeprazole and has made a few dietary modifications.
• Additional Testing: We will order an ultrasound of her right upper quadrant, as well as additional labs, to rule out biliary etiology.
• Medical Treatment: Continue omeprazole 40 mg once daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications.

Gout.
• Medical Reasoning: Her flares are well controlled on allopurinol.
• Medical Treatment: Continue allopurinol 100 mg once daily. This was refilled today.

Arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well and has remained active since her last visit. Physical therapy has also been beneficial for her. Her right knee x-ray demonstrated residual arthritis but was otherwise normal.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised her to continue pilates and using the knee. She will contact me if she has any issues and we can consider further imaging or intervention at that time.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
