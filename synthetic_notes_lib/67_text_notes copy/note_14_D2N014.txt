CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up from an emergency room visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Louis Williams is a 58-year-old male presenting for a follow-up from an emergency room visit.

The patient states that he was playing tennis on Saturday, that he was really hot and that after approximately 30 minutes he was struggling to breathe. He states that he thought he was having a heart attack at that time. His wife took him to the emergency room and at that time, he states that he had been feeling very lightheaded and dizzy. He notes that on Sunday he felt fine.

The patient reports that he has been very diligent with his medications for his congestive heart failure. He notes that he has been avoiding salt for the most part but there has been some dietary indiscretion more recently.

He is status post cataract extraction approximately 3 months ago, and notes that everything has been fine since then. He denies any vision problems at this time.

The patient had a skin cancer removed approximately 5 months ago. He reports this is well healed.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 58-year-old male who presents for follow-up after emergency room visit.

ED follow-up and congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: I believe his symptoms which led to his ED visit were due to an exacerbation of his heart failure. He admits to some dietary indiscretion, which likely resulted in fluid retention.
• Medical Treatment: I will prescribe Lasix 80 mg once a day. I will also place him on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day.

Status post basal cell carcinoma removal.
• Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well and the removal site is well-healed. No change in treatment is necessary at this time.

Status post cataract surgery.
• Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well. We will continue to observe, but no treatment changes are needed today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment.
