ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Lower back pain.
- Medical Reasoning: I believe this is more of a muscular sprain.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed treatment options today.
- Medical Treatment: I am going to start him on Naprosyn 500 mg twice a day and Flexeril 10 mg twice a day. I will refer him for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in his lower back.
- Additional Testing: I do not think he needs an x-ray at this stage, however if he does not improve, we will order one for further evaluation.

2. Diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: His most recent A1c was 7.1 and his blood sugar levels are typically between 120-140.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed treatment options today.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue the metformin 500 mg twice a day.
- Additional Testing: I am going to order another hemoglobin A1c.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: He does have 1+ edema in his legs.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed treatment options today. I explained that his edema is likely caused by the Norvasc.
- Medical Treatment: The patient will discontinue the use of Norvasc and we will start him on hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg once a day.
- Additional Testing: I will order a CBC and BMP. Additionally, I will order a repeat EKG, as well as a chest x-ray.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
