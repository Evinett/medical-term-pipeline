The patient is a 48-year-old female who presents for shortness of breath. She has a history of depression, smoking and chronic back pain.

The patient reports shortness of breath with mild exercise and walking. She also notes some palpitations at times. She is not sure if it is due to her back pain or not. The patient states she has been exercising more. She continues to smoke but has decreased from two packs a day down to a couple of cigarettes daily.

Regarding her depression, the patient feels that it is well managed on Effexor.

Regarding her chronic back pain, the patient has been taking Neurontin, which she states is helping control her pain. She states she tries to get as much rest as she can. She is no longer doing yoga as she has not made it a habit.

RESULTS

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

COPD.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with shortness of breath with exertion. Her pulmonary function tests suggest asthma or COPD and her most recent chest x-ray and physical examination today are also consistent with COPD.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I counseled the patient on the importance of smoking cessation.
• Medical Treatment: We will start the patient on Combivent, 2 puffs twice a day. I will also prescribe an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs as needed, and a prednisone taper pack.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: It sounds like her depression is stable, so we will not change anything at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She will keep taking the Effexor. I encouraged her to practice yoga for depression relief as well as her back pain.

Chronic back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient says she is doing well on Neurontin with only occasional exacerbation of the pain.
• Medical Treatment: She can continue Neurontin as is. I also encouraged her to practice yoga for her back pain.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
