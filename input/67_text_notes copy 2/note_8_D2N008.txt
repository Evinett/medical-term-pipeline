CHIEF COMPLAINT

Abnormal labs.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Stephanie Diaz is a 49-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, kidney stones, and prior colonoscopy, who presents today for abnormal labs.

The patient reports she has been really tired and dizzy over the past couple of months. She reports these symptoms while walking a mile, going to work, and performing daily tasks. She denies any blood in her stools recently but notes she had blood in her stool about 3 years ago and had a colonoscopy for that. She denies any black, tarry stools, heavy menstrual bleeding, unintentional weight loss, or syncope.

Ms. Diaz had a colonoscopy about 3 years ago due to blood in her stool. This showed mild diverticulitis. She denies issues since that time.

Regarding her congestive heart failure, she states she is not doing well with her salt intake. This has been more of a struggle recently as she has been traveling a lot. She has noticed some swelling in her legs but nothing too extreme.

The patient denies recent issues with kidney stones. She denies low back pain, flank pain, or blood in her urine.

Ms. Diaz notes she has had some nasal congestion but attributes this to the season changing. She gets seasonal allergies but everything else has been okay. The patient denies fever, chills, sore throat, or cough.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Stephanie Diaz is a 49-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, kidney stones, and prior colonoscopy, who presents today for abnormal labs.

Anemia.
• Medical Reasoning: This is a new issue. Her recent hemoglobin level was low at 8.2, but she denies any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or urinary tract bleeding, as well as any abnormal menstrual bleeding. Her colonoscopy from 3 years ago demonstrated mild diverticulosis.
• Additional Testing: We will order an anemia profile for further evaluation.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer her back to gastroenterology for repeat evaluation with possible endoscopy and colonoscopy.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She has noticed some lower extremity edema. Her echocardiogram from 6 months ago demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as moderate mitral regurgitation.
• Medical Treatment: We will initiate Lasix 40 mg once daily, and continue with Toprol 50 mg daily and lisinopril 10 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She should continue to limit her sodium intake. I advised her to monitor her daily weights and notify me if these start to increase.

Kidney stones.
• Medical Reasoning: She as asymptomatic denies any recent flare ups.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications and proper hydration. She will contact me with any questions or concerns.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
