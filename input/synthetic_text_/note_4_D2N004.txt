CHIEF COMPLAINT

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

James Allen is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and type 2 diabetes, who presents today with back pain.

The patient states he was golfing and hurt his back. This happened approximately 4 days ago when he felt a pop in his back. The patient notes that he immediately hit the ground trying to loosen up his back. He reports taking some Tylenol, ibuprofen, and using ice and heat which did not relieve the pain. By Monday morning it loosened up a little bit, but it is still pretty sore. He had some right lower extremity weakness and some drop foot that he felt that for a while, and it got a little better this morning but not much. He had surgery about 10 years ago in his lower back.

Regarding his congestive heart failure, he has been watching his diet and trying to exercise regularly. He is avoiding the salty foods and has been compliant with medications. He has gained a little weight over the summer but nothing more than 5 pounds. He has no problems lying flat to go to bed.

Regarding his diabetes, he is watching his blood sugars at home, not always consistently. He is still on his metformin.
