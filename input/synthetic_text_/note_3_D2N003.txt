CHIEF COMPLAINT

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with some back pain.

The patient reports that he is feeling a lot of the same pain that he had when he had kidney stones about 2 years ago, so he is a little concerned. The pain started from the right side and moved over and he feels it on the left side of his back. This has been going on for the last 4 days. Initially, the pain was intermittent, but over the last 48 hours it has been constant. He has taken Tylenol, but it does not seem to help. He thinks he has hematuria, but it is hard to detect but it does look a little off color. He endorses nausea and vomiting if he exerts himself or climbs the stairs to his apartment or runs to catch the bus. He also endorses dizziness and lightheadedness with pain in his abdomen.

Regarding his migraines, he has been diligent about taking the Imitrex. He denies issues with the migraines.

Regarding his gastroesophageal reflux, he reports that he has been doing well with his diet, but notes lately with his pain, he has been eating more fast food and takeout since these options come with delivery. He is staying hydrated. He is taking Protonix 40 mg daily as directed.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with back pain.

Kidney stones.
• Medical Reasoning: He is experiencing pain in his back that is similar to his previous kidney stone pain. His recent abdominal x-ray demonstrates what appears to be a recurrent kidney stone.
• Additional Testing: I have ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast.
• Medical Treatment: We will start him on Ultram 50 mg as needed every 6 hours for pain.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to stay well hydrated and to strain his urine.

Migraines.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with Imitrex and is doing well at this time.
• Medical Treatment: Continue Imitrex.

Reflux.
• Medical Reasoning: This is typically well-controlled with dietary modifications.
• Medical Treatment: Continue with Protonix 40 mg daily. A refill was provided.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
