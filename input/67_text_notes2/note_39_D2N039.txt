ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Hypertension, uncontrolled.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's elevated blood pressure is consistent with uncontrolled hypertension.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the nature of the diagnosis and that this is typically multifactorial. I advised the patient that further testing should reveal additional information. She was encouraged to reduce her intake of alcohol as well as her salt intake. I recommended that she stop taking anti-inflammatories and use Tylenol as needed for pain. We also discussed the importance of home blood pressure monitoring of the next 3 weeks to see if the medication is beneficial.
- Medical Treatment: Renal artery ultrasound ordered. Urine collection, morning aldosterone levels, renal levels, and a 24-hour urine were also ordered. Referral to nutritionist provided. Prescription for Cardura 4 mg once a day provided as well.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
