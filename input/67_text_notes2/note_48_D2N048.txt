HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Brittany Edwards is a 76-year-old female, right-hand-dominant, female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The onset of her pain began 2 days ago, when she was playing tennis and was trying to volley the ball when she got in front of another player and fell on the dorsal aspect of her right foot. She states that she quickly twisted her foot because she was trying to catch herself. The patient reports that she was unable to continue playing secondary to the pain. She states that she wrapped her foot after the game and iced it last night. The patient adds that she kept her foot up on a pillow and took ibuprofen for pain. She denies any numbness. The patient denies any loss of sensation.

The patient has a history of a left leg injury.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.
Neurological: Denies numbness in the right foot.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: Warm
NEURO: Normal sensation.
MSK:
Examination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
Examination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.
