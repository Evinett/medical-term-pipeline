CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alan Mitchell is a pleasant 69-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago, without any improvement. He denies any specific injury; however, he has been renovating his basement and putting in a new ceiling. He does not recall hitting or falling onto the left shoulder. The patient states he is very active and has experienced left shoulder pain before that usually resolves with Tylenol.

The patient reports significant pain with reaching, lifting, and overhead activities. The pain is constant. He states the pain is primarily located in the left shoulder and denies it radiates down into the left arm. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping secondary to the pain. He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip. Neurovascularly intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.
