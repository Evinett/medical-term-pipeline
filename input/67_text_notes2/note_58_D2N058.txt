ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's exam is consistent with coronary artery disease.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that he should continue to watch his diet and salt intake. We also discussed that the cardiac rehab should help with his confidence with exercising regularly and for his education.
- Medical Treatment: Continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily Continue taking Brilinta 90 mg twice a day. Continue taking Lipitor 80 mg daily. Continue taking Toprol 50 mg daily. I will refer him to cardiac rehab.

2. Newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's physical exam is consistent with this diagnosis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that his pumping function should improve in time. We also discussed that since he is compliant with his medications and presented to the cardiac cath lab quickly, he should recover. I advised the patient that he does not need to start a diuretic at this time.
- Medical Treatment: Continue taking lisinopril 20 mg a day. Prescription for Aldactone 12.5 mg daily provided. Order for labs provided. Repeat echocardiogram ordered to be completed in 2 months.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This seems stable at this time.
- Medical Treatment: Continue home blood pressure monitoring.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
