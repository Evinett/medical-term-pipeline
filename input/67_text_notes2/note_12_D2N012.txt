HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Fisher is a 59-year-old male who presents for routine follow up of his chronic problems.

Mr. Fisher reports that he has been managing his depression. He is on Prozac 20 mg daily and was taking it regularly, but weaned himself off of it and felt a little better. He is currently taking less of a dose and does not feel the side effects as much, but he is willing to try something different. His asthma has been acting up because of the bad pollen season and has been using his inhaler when it seems to go over 85 degrees. He does not use it if it is cold outside. He is keeping his diabetes under control. The patient 's diet has been good for the most part, but has been traveling all over for his children's sports tournaments and did not stick to his diet and notes over the weekend eating pizza.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. Joseph Fisher is a 59-year-old male who presents for routine follow up of his chronic problems.

Asthma.
• Medical Reasoning: His symptoms are exacerbated during warmer weather, but his recent pulmonary function tests were normal.
• Medical Treatment: Continue on albuterol, 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed. Add Symbicort 2 puffs twice a day during the summer to help prevent exacerbation.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient self-weened from Prozac 20 mg daily due to side effects.
• Medical Treatment: We will start him on a different medication, Zoloft 25 mg once a day, to see how he tolerates this.

Diabetes Type II.
• Medical Reasoning: Recent blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c were elevated.
• Additional Testing: Repeat hemoglobin A1c in 3 months. Continue to monitor blood glucose levels at home.
• Medical Treatment: We will increase metformin to 1000 mg twice a day.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
