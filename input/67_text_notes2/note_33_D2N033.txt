ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right knee pain.
- Medical Reasoning: I am concerned about a torn MCL due to pain on ambulation and trouble with weightbearing, as well as the pop she heard.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed treatment options today including bracing, anti-inflammatories, and icing. - Medical Treatment: I am going to put her in a straight leg brace and I will prescribe some Mobic. She can start taking that as a pain reliever and to try to get some of the swelling down. I want her to ice her knee once an hour for about 15 minutes.
- Additional Testing: I am also going to send her out for an MRI.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient states that her type 2 diabetes are well-managed.
- Medical Treatment: I am also going to get a refill on the metformin that she has been taking 500 mg.
- Additional Testing: We are going to recheck her hemoglobin A1c.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
